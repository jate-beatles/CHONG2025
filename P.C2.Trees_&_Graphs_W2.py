#### Graph Introduction 
#       Relation are initi and nodes 
#       1. no self-loops   
#       2. Muliedge - 
#
####   Where do the graph come from?  - social network/computer network/ecologial relationwork/electricl circuite
#            traversal problems /find the spinning trees/flow ....etc.
#       1. Adjacency  matrix   
#       2. Adjacency list representation  -!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - Adjacency List Representation 
#       3. Incidcence representation 


#  Vertic/node  -------- the connection between the node  ''' edge''''
#  graph []e.g. the sereve is the node, the link is the edge
#               google map  ------ street, ----- edge  



#### How to represent the graph on the computer
#       1. adjacency matrix  --- graph is define by the matrix, vertices is from the rows and column [n_ij] is representh the edge
#           k nodes will have the k(k-1) edge, e.g., many of the matrix store the (0,0) 
#       2. adjacency list representive --------every node points  to list of the neighbors  ---- adjacency node  ( thus there is not storage the 0.0)
#           |k| + |m|  is the size of the adjacency list representative
#       3. incidence matrix representive
#

####    Traversals --
#       operation of the graph  -
